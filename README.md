# ForecastingQuantiles
This repo is very much a lighter version of https://github.com/ig248/deepquantiles that I used for my less demanding needs and for which
I added some documentation for me to look back at.

The accompanying [blog posts](https://ig248.gitlab.io) describe the ins and outs of the quantile forecasts. Such forecasts are used to estimate
the different quantiles of a prediction interval and better grasp the underlying uncertainty around the usual point forecast E[Y|X]. 

This set up is particularly useful for many related time series as we can expect the similar behaviors to provide additional data to learn the forecast uncertainty.
